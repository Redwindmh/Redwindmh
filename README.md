# Hello, world! <a href="https://redwindmh.github.io/MH_3D_Portfolio/" style="color:crimson; text-decoration:none;">Malcolm Hendricks</a> here!

Hello and thanks for reading! I'm a professional translator, editor, and writer turned programmer and web developer. While I may be relatively new to the world of programming and computer science, my passion for it can be seen in the many projects both software and hardware-based that I am forever building!

My current focus as a programmer is on React-based frontend with a Django backend, but I also have experience building web apps using WordPress, Laravel, and WYSIWYG services like Wix.

Recently, I've been working on two major personal projects. The first is an online version of the board game called [Covenants](https://github.com/Redwindmh/Covenants), as invented by comic book creator Andrew Carl, using TypeScript in React, webhooks, and hosting it on my own Nginx web server running on a Raspberry Pi. The second is a perhaps overly ambitious idea that ties my two professions--web development and translation--together: an AI Assisted Translation project called [Redsetta](https://github.com/Redwindmh/Redsetta_Stone) using AI specifically for English <--> Japanese translation. If you are interested in collaborating or perhaps helping me find rare and obscure Japanese language resources to train my AI on, please contact me anytime!

Here is a quick chart of my other projects and forays into technomancy:
